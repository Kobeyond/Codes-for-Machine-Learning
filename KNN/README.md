# KNN

The k-nearest neighbors algorithm `kNN` is a non-parametric method used for classification, which is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification. 
Here, we will use kNN algorithm to predict result for dating website and handwriting recognization.

## Dating website
Given flying miles, ice cream ate every week and video games played, predict whether Sophia will appreciate the person.  

| miles | ice cream | video games | result
| :-----: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------------:
| 40920 | 8.326976 | 0.953952 | largeDoses
| 14488 | 7.153469 | 1.673904 | smallDoses
| 26052 | 1.441871 | 0.805124 | didntLike 


## Handwriting recognization
Given digit file, which consists of 32 rows and 32 columns with the element 0 or 1, predict the number it represents.
