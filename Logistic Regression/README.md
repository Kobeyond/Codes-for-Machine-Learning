# Logistic Regression

`Logistic Regression` algorithm is mainly used to binary classification, which aims at finding a best decision boundary
to separate the training examples. While z >= 0 means positive (above the line), and z <= 0 means negative(beyond the
line). In addition, g(z) represents the probability of positive.

## Horse Colic classification
Given various symptoms of a horse, we use logistic regression to predict whether the horse is suffering colic(1 or 0).
