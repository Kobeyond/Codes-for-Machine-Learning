# Codes-for-Machine-Learning

This project covers most of the common machine learning algorithms implemented by `Python3` and `Numpy`. The overall idea of my 
codes follows the book named `Machine Learning In Action`. 

However, in order to reconstruct it in a clearer way, I encapsule the codes using `OOP`(hopefully), and add many `mathematical principles` in detail, which are not mentioned in the book, to many algorithms.
