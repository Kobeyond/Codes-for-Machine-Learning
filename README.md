# Codes-for-Machine-Learning

This project covers most of the common machine learning algorithms implemented by `Python3` and `Numpy`. The overall idea of my 
codes follows the book named `Machine Learning In Action`. However, in order to bulid it as a clearer structure, I encapsule
the codes using `OOP`(hopefully).
